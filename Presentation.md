### Insights
1. Treatment subscription plan has a higher conversion rate and generates slightly more revenue than the control subscription.
2. The monthly plan has a higher activated trial period ratio, but a lower purchase ratio compared to the weekly tariff.

### Recommendation
It's recommended implementing the Treatment (weekly subscription plan) due to its higher conversion rate and revenue generation capabilities. However, it's essential to consider the long-term implications.

### Considerations
It's important to note that while the weekly subscription plan shows promising results in the short term, there are considerations for long-term sustainability. It's possible that a monthly subscription plan may yield better results over time, potentially reducing churn rate and maximizing revenue. Tracking the performance closely and considering a switch to a monthly subscription plan to mitigate churn and optimize revenue should be considered.
